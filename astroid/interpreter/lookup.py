    For function nodes, this will be the local variables defined in

    defined in the module, what would be returned by a locals() or

    class attributes defined in the class body, also what a locals()
    call in the body would return.

    This function starts by recursing over its argument's children to
    avoid incorrectly adding a class's, function's, or module's name
    to its own local variables.

    Args:
        node (LocalsDictNode): A node defining a scope to return locals for.

    Returns:
        A defaultdict(list) mapping names (strings) to lists of nodes.
